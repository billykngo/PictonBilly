## TODO

- [ ] **Change API URLs in Frontend**  
  I changed the project structure and cleaned up code in the backend so that the project is more scalable. However, this changed all the backend API URLs, so I need to find where they are used in the frontend and update them accordingly.
  - [X] Partially Finished

- [ ] **Test After Code Cleanup**  
  I haven't tested whether the code cleanup broke any existing logic, but it runs with no errors. I have to test it after completing the above TODO first.
  - [X] Login with email and outlook works, dashboard views also still work like before

- [ ] **Cleanup Frontend**  
  The frontend code is somewhat messy. After completing the above two TODOs, I need to find a way to make the frontend project more scalable for long-term maintenance.
